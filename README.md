Job Tracker
-----------

Job Tracker is a program that helps track which jobs have been applied to, when,
and whether there has been any response.

This is being written because I'm having a hard time remember what I
have/haven't applied to yet. Double applying is bad.

Design
------

How it works:

1. Run the program.
2. Choose whether to see jobs or to enter a job.
2a. Viewing will be a table via command line that will show several things:
    ID Number?
    Company
    Job Name
    Job Description? (might be too long)
    Date Applied
    Date Update Requested?
    Response (automated, human, interview, offer, rejection)

    Editing a job will be done from here
2b. Entering a job will give prompts that will ask for aforementioned info.

Additional features may be added if I think of them, but only after this works.
